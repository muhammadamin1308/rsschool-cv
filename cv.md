# About Me
I'm 17 years old  Web Developer with 1 year of experience. Now I'm studying in **RSSchool** to enhance my developer skills.

# Code example:
#### Description:
> The drawing shows 6 squares the sides of which have a length of 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8. It's easy to see that the sum of the perimeters of these squares is : 4 * (1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8) = 4 * 20 = 80. 
Could you give the sum of the perimeters of all the squares in a rectangle when there are n + 1 squares disposed in the same manner as in the drawing:


``` js
function perimeter(n) {
  if(n === 0) return 4
    let n1 = 1, n2 = 2, sum
    for(let i = 1; i <= n; i++){
      sum = n1 + n2;
      n1 = n2;
      n2 = sum;
    }
    let fib = Number(sum * 4 - 4)
    return fib
}
```
